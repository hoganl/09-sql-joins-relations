# Lab 09 SQL Joins and Queries

**Author**: Lacy and Collin
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Our problem domain is combining two tables of information and then referencing that information to populate and update a page of articles.

## Getting Started
A user must build a server.js file that creates a database table, and then draws from that table in order to display its information in the browser. They can test this functionality with a postgres shell.

## Architecture
This application runs from server.js, putting information into a database and then calling it back. We use express and other node plugins, as well as SQL.
